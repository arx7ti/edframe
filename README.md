End-to-End Energy Disaggregation in Python

## Important Note
> :warning: **Notification:** we apologize for the pause in the development of this library as we were involved into another major work on synthetic data over last few months. The new synthetic data generators were commited into `dev` branch. Since now, we resume the work on this library.

Dear users,

this library is still under development. The alpha version is expected to be released before end of January, 2024. You are welcome to contribute to the development.

Please, use `yapf` formatter before pull-request.
